            <h2>Computer Fundamentals</h2>
                Computer fundamentals refer to the basic components and concepts of computers. They are the foundation on which the more advanced concepts are built. Understanding the fundamentals of computers is essential for anyone wishing to use computers effectively.

                A computer system consists of hardware, software, and networks. Hardware consists of physical components such as the processor, memory, storage, input devices, output devices, and other peripherals. The processor is the brain of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions. Memory stores data and programs during execution. Storage devices such as hard disks or flash drives are used to store data permanently. Input devices such as the keyboard and mouse allow users to interact with the computer. Output devices such as displays and printers provide visual and physical output. Network devices such as modems and routers allow computers to communicate with each other.

                Software is the set of instructions that control a computer's hardware. It can be divided into two categories: system software and application software. System software includes the operating system and device drivers. The operating system controls the hardware and provides basic functions such as memory management and file system management. Device drivers are software programs that allow hardware components to be used by the computer. Application software includes programs such as word processors, web browsers, and games.
