            <h2>Language C</h2>
            C is a high-level programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories. It was designed to be a portable, efficient and flexible language for writing system software, including operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems.
            <br><br>
            C is a procedural language, meaning that it works by executing instructions from top to bottom, with the ability to define functions and store variables. It is a compiled language, meaning that it must be translated from human-readable source code into machine-readable code before it can be executed. The source code is written in a text editor, and then compiled with a C compiler which generates an executable binary.
            <br><br>
            C is a statically typed language, meaning that all data types must be declared before they can be used. It has a variety of built-in data types and allows user-defined data types, such as structures and unions. It also supports pointer arithmetic and has various operators and control structures, including if-else, while and for loops.
            <br><br>
            C is widely used in many different types of software development. It is an excellent choice for writing system software, as it is highly efficient and compatible with many different types of hardware. It is also used for developing embedded systems, such as microcontrollers
