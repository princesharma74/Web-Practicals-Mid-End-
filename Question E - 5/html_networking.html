            <h2>HTML & Networking</h2>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying web pages and applications. Its main purpose is to enable web browsers to interpret and display content correctly, and to provide a structure for the layout of web documents. 
            <br><br>
            HTML is made up of elements, which are the building blocks of web pages. An element is a collection of related tags, attributes, and content, which together form a unit that is used to describe a particular piece of information. For example, an h1 element might contain a heading and a paragraph, while a form element might contain a form and its associated fields. Each element can have attributes, which are additional pieces of information that can be used to further describe the element. 
            <br><br>
            Networking is a term used to describe the process of connecting and interacting with other people in a professional or social environment. This can include building relationships with peers, colleagues, and potential employers. Networking is an important part of developing and maintaining professional relationships, and is essential for career growth and advancement.
            <br><br>
            Networking is a way of exchanging contacts, information and resources between individuals, groups and organizations. It can take place in person, online or both. In-person networking typically involves attending conferences, seminars and other professional events. Online networking involves using online tools such as social media, websites, blogs and forums.
