    <h2>Ashoka Chakra</h2>
        <p>
            The Ashoka Chakra, seen at the center of the Indian National Flag, is a 24-spoke wheel that has been used since ancient times in the Indian culture and philosophy. This 24-spoke Chakra is taken from the Ashok Chakra of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. The Chakra is said to represent the Dharma Chakra that is seen on Indian coins and currency and symbolizes justice, righteousness and the Persian wheels of destiny.
            <br><br>
            The Ashok Chakra stands for the rule of law and justice and is said to convey the idea of rebirth and Wheel of Dharma. In the Indian National Flag, the Ashok Chakra is said to represent the nation’s commitment to its citizens represented by the three colors. The number of spokes in the Ashok Chakra is said to represent the 24 hours in a day or the 24-Spoke Yantra of the Hindu religion.
            <br><br>
            The Ashok Chakra is said to symbolize unity, integrity and national spirit. It is not only seen as a symbol of justice and righteousness but also as a reminder of the country’s commitment to sticking to its constitution and values. This chakra also serves as a reminder to the country to uphold its commitment to liberty, egalitarianism, justice and unity.
