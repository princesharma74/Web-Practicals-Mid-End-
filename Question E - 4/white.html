    <h2>White</h2>
        <p>
            White is the second color used in the national flag of India, the other two being saffron and green. The white color has a duality, it represents peace and truth as well as purity and cleanliness. The white color brings out the peace and truth of the nation.
            White is a symbol of shared purity. The White color denotes peace and neutrality, which is the ideal environment in which the nation can uphold its values, justice and aspirations. White signifies cleanliness and is a symbol of India's commitment to keeping the environment and natural resources pristine.
            <br><br>
            At the same time, the white color stands for honesty and fidelity which are among the cardinal virtues of a nation. It is a positive symbol of having faith and strength which is born out of working together. White also serves to pay tribute to the many saints and freedom fighters of India who dedicated their lives towards standing up for the values of justice, harmony and peace.
            <br><br>
            The three colored stripes of the flag, with white in the middle, denotes the strength that the union of the three colors and the nation derives from it. When the three colors of saffron, white and green stand together for the common cause of national unity, the virtuous values of strength and courage of the citizens of India are highlighted.
