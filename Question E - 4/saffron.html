    <h2>Saffron</h2>
        <p>
            Saffron is one of the three colors used in the Indian National Flag, the other two being white and green. The saffron color is a special type of yellow- orange hue, which is sometimes referred to as “kesari” or “kesar.” This saffron color, which was chosen by Mahatma Gandhi and is seen as a representation of strength, signifies the color of courage and greatness. The saffron, when blended with the other colors on the national flag, lends a feeling of courage and religiosity to the nation.
            Saffron occupies a huge area in the topmost region of the Indian national flag. Since the flag has an area of two to three- fourths in which the saffron is placed at the top, the color therefore symbolizes three important virtues namely strength, fearlessness, and sacrifice.
            The saffron color also symbolizes renunciation and austerity as Siddhartha Gautama, who later became the Buddha, renounced all worldly goods, renounced his family and went on a journey to find enlightenment while wearing saffron-colored robes. This same color has been used to signify the strength and courage of soldiers in the Indian Army, who are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect the nation.
            <br><br>
            The saffron color also stands for those who lived their lives in the spirit of national service. Hence, the color symbolizes our fearless leaders who epitomized their selfless service for the nation and its people.
